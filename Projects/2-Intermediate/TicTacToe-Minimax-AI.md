# Tic-Tac-Toe game against AI 

Tier: 2-Intermediate

Create a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game played against an unbeatable AI using Minimax algorithm.

The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’). If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.

Introducing unbeatable AI in it, where the AI will calculate all the possible moves available for it and use minimax Algorithm to determine the best possible move to play against the player.
